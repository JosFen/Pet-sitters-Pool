# Pet-sitters Pool
### A Pet-sitter Management Application
***
## Background
#### *What this application does?*
This application allows users to manage, view and maintain information of pet-sitters.  
It allows users to **CRUD** *(create/read/update/delete)* information of pet-sitters.  
Users can also select and view detailed information about a specific pet-sitter.
#### *Who should use this application?*
Any organizations (nonprofit or not) can use this application to create and manage a pool of pet-sitters that provide 
services to their clients.  
Any individuals who need pet-sitting services can also use this application to keep track of pet-sitters found   
in their cities for later usage, as well as to rate the pet-sitters used.

#### *Why this project is of interest to me?*
As a cat parent of 2 cats, I saw that pet parents around me have encountered the same difficulty of finding reliable  
pet-sitters who could provide desired pet-sitting services when pet parents have to be away from home.   
Meanwhile, it would also be great if there is an application that allows pet parents to create, view and update   
their own collections of pet-sitters found and used.
